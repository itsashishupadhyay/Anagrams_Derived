Anagrams

I am looking for derived anagrams in a dictionary. 
Derived anagram is a word that consists of all the letters from the base word plus one more letter, rearranged 
ex. sail→nails → aliens .
C++ (working in terminal) it'll will import dictionary from external text file (one word each row), than input a starting 3 letter word and search for the longest anagram chain based on this starting word. All words in the chain must be contained in the dictionary. There may be more than one longest chain and you should find a way to show them alternatively.
